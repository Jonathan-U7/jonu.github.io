Final Project for WEB-DEV (CS463)
------------- Anything below the line are instructions from the assignment ------------
- Instructions:
    - The site contains a number of sections accessible on a navbar
        - Upon smaller windows, navbar compresses into a dropdown, where each 
            option on the navbar is still accessible
    - Of those sectinos: 
    - Home Page: 
        - Contains a starter image, as well as introduction text
    - About Me: 
        - Contains an image carousel and bio text
    - Previous Work:
        - An embedded resume 
        - Interactive button to download resume
        - Link that redirects to LinkedIn
    - Projects:
        - List of projects
        - Each project contains title, description text, and link to repo
    - Form: 
        - Asks for information, where console is able to print responses inputted. 

- Although there are multiple files being used in this project,
    running the code only requires access to opening a single html file. So long
    as all of the other files are within the folder, the single file will access
    all of the pages. The code for testing purposes is ran through Live Server, 
    an extension available via VS code. The site itself is deployed on github. 

- This code includes 2 separate bootstrap bundles that are accessible from the web.
